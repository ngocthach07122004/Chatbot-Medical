We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10."}

The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home."}

Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian."}

Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss.

Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning. The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy. Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern). When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques. The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse. To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow. After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough. He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning. To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night. Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization. At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support."}

After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50).

SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists.

Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate.

Skin biopsy objectified ulcerated epidermotropic dermo-hypodermal tumor proliferation whose morphological appearance and immunohistochemical data are in favor of LCH. Langerhans cells present positivity of the anti-PS100 antibody, anti-CD1a antibody, and anti-Ki67 antibody (60%), and negativity of the anti-CD68 antibody. The patient subsequently received 25 sessions of radiotherapy followed by six courses of chemotherapy with a low dose of oral methotrexate. After these treatments, skin lesions are stable. In 2020, the patient complained of an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of several infiltrating nodules, scaling, crusted papules, and ulcerated plaques. The patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions. After two courses, the patient was lost to follow-up. One year later, the oncologist referred the patient to the hematology department for a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. Dermatological examination found ulcers and necrotic lesions, purplish, well-limited, of variable size, not painful, not warm to the skin, and localized to the right thigh. The mucous membranes and integuments were unharmed (Figure ).\nFurthermore, the examination found an afebrile, obese patient (body mass index (BMI) at 44.8). Abdominal and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. The physical examination did not find any tumoral syndromes, and the patient did not present have B signs (fever, weight loss, and night sweats).

Extensive investigation revealed no systemic involvement, central nervous system (CNS) evaluation was not done, serum thyroid hormone levels were normal, endocrine workup was performed, including cortisolemia, and parathormone assessment were done in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism. A skin biopsy was performed. The microscopic examination revealed a cutaneous tissue with an infiltrate of large cells involving the dermis and realizing an epidermotropism. The infiltrate was composed of atypical cells with abundant, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular and elongated or lobed nuclei with prominent nuclear grooves and folds, fine chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli. Multinucleated giant tumor cells, high cytonuclear atypia, and marked nuclear pleomorphism were seen. The mitotic figures were increased. The neoplastic cells also showed a mixed inflammatory background with variable numbers of reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, benign histiocytes, and eosinophils associated (Figure ).\nThe immunohistochemical stains had shown a diffuse strong and heterogeneous positivity for CD1a and S100 and variable positivity for CD45. All other markers studied were negative, including CD68, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and melanocytic marker (MelanA). The Ki-67 proliferation index was high (50%) (Figure ).\nIn the light of microscopic and phenotypic results, the diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was confirmed. The patient did not receive any maintenance therapy and she received only two courses of chemotherapy; consequently, the patient was included in the LCH protocol as single-system LCH (SS-LCH), and she received the same chemotherapy combining prednisone (60 mg / m2), high-dose of methotrexate (5000 mg/m2), and vinblastine (10 mg/m2).
